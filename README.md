# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test # test don't work for now
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js # don't forget to copy/past your SOL file from contracts/****.json to frontend/contracts/*****json

```
Run the app localy :

```shell
cd frontend
npm i
npm run dev
```
